# Trace's ReliabilityTracker using Lost segment
This project is based on packet sniffing and packet capturing using wireshark. It uses
a packet filtering option provided in the wireshark to calculate the number of
segments lost.
<br>The project uses a python code to calculate the reliability of the packets captured
and displays it in the output window. It uses ping command to send a bunch of data
bytes to the target website and based on the response it calculates the number of
untraceable packets.
## Features:
- Enables the user to test the reliability of the capture.
- Enables ping to see system server connection and tests its reliablity using sniffing.
